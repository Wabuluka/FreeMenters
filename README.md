Free Mentors is a social initiative where accomplished professionals become role models to
young people to provide free mentorship sessions.

## Getting Started
To get started with Free Mentors, a user must create an account with the system that is hosted online in order to provide access to world wide users. A user with an account can gain access by simply logging into the system. 

In case one wants to test Free Mentors manually offline, they can do so by simply following the steps defined below in a sequence.

### Prerequisites
Firstly, the following prerequisites have to be fulfilled for the system to get working on one's offline version.

* Make sure you have installed git on your system
- If you have not yet done so you may have problems with some commands I will be describing here. because the commands shall cut across all the operating system platforms

* Clone the entire repo on to your local machine
```
$git clone https://github.com/Wabuluka/FreeMentors.git
```
- This should download the system code to your offline machine

* The machine can be of any operating system

* After successfully downloading the code, in the git bash terminal, head to the folder containing the code. This must be called FreeMentors
```
$cd FreeMentors
```

* While in the root folder of the code, install all the required dependencies
```
$npm install
```
- The above command will install all the required dependencies for the system to work

* After the installation has successfully completed, it is time to run the system.
```
$npm start
```
- This shall start the server

* In order to easily test the system , I recommend having Postman installed on your computer
After all the above are met, it is time to start testing the system.
